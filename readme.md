# Bot Manager
A Global Bot Manager for Discord, soon to be twitch, and the rest of the world.

List of things needing fixes/todo:
- ERROR LOGGING AND VIEWING!!!
- Make restore actually restore if the command is ran in the same discord as it was created in.
- Shard between bot/music/etc. correctly.
- Fix leveling
- Implement from Channel for Message Command
- Move Command Usage Params into own object for greater use of them.
- Add checks to make sure bot has the correct permissions before running the command(s). (ex: in prune command file)
Double Check:
- Punishments



Code Cleanup since all I did was keep mindlessly adding commands.
